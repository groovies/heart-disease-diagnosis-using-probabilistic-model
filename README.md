# heart-disease-diagnosis-using-probabilistic-model

Heart and blood vessel syndromes are categorised as cardiovascular disease (CVD), which comprises of heart failure, high blood pressure, peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerotic heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, stroke, congenital heart disease, and heart muscle disease (Setiawan et al., 2016). Based on statistics over 12 million people are dying every year from heart disease (Golande et al., 2019).

# Description of heart disease dataset(cleveland dataset)
The dataset consists of seventy-six attributes with three hundred and three patient records. Although the dataset consists of seventy-six attributes, most researchers have used fourteen attributes to diagnose heart disease with thirteen attributes used as input data and the 14th attribute depicting heart disease presence or absence (Praneetha Meegahalanda Durange, 2018). This dataset is readily accessible from the UCI machine-learning repository

1	Age- Patient’s age 	

2	Sex-	Patient’s gender	(Male or Female)

3	Chest_Pain_Type- 	Chest pain	(1: Typical angina 2: Atypical angina 3: Non-angina pain 4: Asymptomatic	Nominal)

4	Trestbps-	Resting blood pressure (on admission to hospital) in mmHg) 		Numeric

5	Cholesterol	-Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)	[1 = True 0 = False	Numeric]

6	Fbs	-Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl	0: Normal 1: Non Nominal)

7	RestECG	-Resting electrocardiographic results	(0: Normal 1: ST_T abnormal 2: Hypertrophy	Nominal)

8	Thalach	-Maximum heart rate achieved	

9	Exang-	Exercise-induced angina	(1: Yes 0: No	Nominal)

10	OldPeak-	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest		Numeric

11	Slope-	The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (	1: Upsloping 2: Flat 3: Downsloping	)

12	Ca -Number of major vessels (0-3) coloured by fluoroscopy	( 1: Mild 2: Moderate 3: Severe)

13	Thal- Status of the heart	(3: Normal 6: Fixed defect 7: Reversible defect)

14	target-	Heart disease diagnosis	(0: Healthy 1: Sick)
